- Removed Req: e2fsutils (wasn't needed long time ago, we use
  romfs), trash and insmod.static - they are replaced by bsp.
  Rationale:
  They can be needed when special option are turned on,
  but in normal config they are not, and as this is base
  pkg, user should not be forced to install them.
